# SmartKitchen Connect Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. IEEE 830 Compliance

**MUST** follow IEEE 830-1998 standard for all software requirements specifications.

Every functional requirement (RF) and non-functional requirement (RNF) MUST be:
- Uniquely identified with traceable ID (e.g., RF-01, RNF-03)
- Documented with clear description, priority, and acceptance criteria
- Linked to implementation components (apps, modules, services)
- Validated through test cases and acceptance scenarios

**Rationale**: IEEE 830 compliance ensures consistent, verifiable, and maintainable requirements documentation that facilitates stakeholder communication and regulatory compliance.

### II. Design Thinking Methodology

**MUST** apply all five Design Thinking phases to feature development:

1. **Empathize**: Understand user pain points through research and observation
2. **Define**: Clearly articulate problems with measurable impact
3. **Ideate**: Generate creative, human-centered solutions
4. **Prototype**: Build iterative functional modules with Django REST Framework
5. **Evaluate**: Validate with real users, measuring satisfaction and performance

Each feature specification MUST document which Design Thinking phase insights drove design decisions.

**Rationale**: Design Thinking ensures solutions are user-centered, innovative, and validated before full implementation, reducing rework and improving user satisfaction.

### III. Modular Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**MUST** organize code into independent, self-contained Django apps following single responsibility principle.

Each app MUST:
- Serve a single business capability (users, orders, inventory, dishes)
- Be independently testable without requiring other apps
- Expose functionality through documented REST API endpoints
- Include models, serializers, views, admin interfaces, and tests
- Use clear naming conventions: `apps/<domain>/`

**Anti-patterns FORBIDDEN**:
- Organizational-only apps (e.g., "common", "utils" without clear domain purpose)
- Circular dependencies between apps
- Direct database queries across app boundaries (use APIs instead)

**Rationale**: Modular architecture enables parallel development, easier testing, independent deployment, and clearer ownership of business capabilities.

### IV. Requirements Traceability

**MUST** maintain bidirectional traceability between requirements and implementation.

Every code component (model, view, serializer, endpoint) MUST:
- Include docstring comment linking to requirement ID (e.g., `# IEEE 830: RF-01`)
- Document which Design Thinking phase informed its design
- Explain human value delivered (not just technical function)

Every requirement MUST:
- Link to implementing modules in traceability matrix
- Include acceptance criteria that can be validated through tests
- Reference user role(s) affected (Customer, Cook, Inventory Manager, Administrator, Waiter)

**Rationale**: Traceability prevents scope creep, enables impact analysis for changes, facilitates compliance audits, and ensures every line of code delivers documented value.

### V. Code Quality & Documentation

**MUST** maintain PEP8 compliance and comprehensive documentation.

All Python code MUST:
- Follow PEP8 style guide (enforced by flake8, formatted by black)
- Include docstrings (Google or reStructuredText format) for all public interfaces
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Keep line length ≤ 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable/function names avoiding abbreviations

All API endpoints MUST:
- Be documented in OpenAPI/Swagger format
- Include request/response examples
- Document error codes and handling
- Specify authentication requirements

**Rationale**: Consistent code quality and documentation reduces onboarding time, prevents bugs, enables automated tooling, and facilitates team collaboration.

### VI. Test Coverage Standards

**MUST** maintain minimum 80% test coverage for all apps.

Testing requirements:
- **Unit tests**: All models, serializers, utility functions
- **Integration tests**: API endpoints, database interactions, signal handlers
- **Contract tests**: API contracts when dependencies exist
- Use pytest, pytest-django, factory-boy for test infrastructure
- Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation (TDD encouraged)
- Tests MUST fail before implementation proves they work

Coverage reporting:
- Run `pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=html` before every commit
- CI/CD pipeline MUST fail if coverage drops below 80%
- Exclude migrations, `__init__.py`, and admin configs from coverage

**Rationale**: High test coverage prevents regressions, documents expected behavior, enables confident refactoring, and serves as executable specifications.

### VII. Security & Authentication

**MUST** implement secure authentication and authorization for all endpoints.

Security requirements (RNF-03):
- JWT authentication required for all non-public endpoints
- Token expiration: 60 minutes (access), 7 days (refresh)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at view level
- Environment variables for sensitive data (never commit secrets)
- HTTPS/SSL required in production
- CORS properly configured with whitelist

User roles and permissions:
- **Customer**: Read menu, create orders, view own order history
- **Cook**: View/update order status, access kitchen dashboard
- **Inventory Manager**: Manage ingredients, stock levels, generate reports
- **Administrator**: Full access, user management, system configuration
- **Waiter**: Create orders on behalf of customers, view order status

**Rationale**: Security-first approach protects user data, ensures compliance with data protection regulations, prevents unauthorized access, and builds user trust.

## Technical Standards

### Technology Stack

**Backend Framework**: Django 5.2.7 with Django REST Framework 3.16.1  
**Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ (production), SQLite3 (development)  
**Authentication**: JWT via djangorestframework-simplejwt 5.3.0  
**API Documentation**: drf-yasg (Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0)  
**Testing**: pytest 8.4.2, pytest-django, pytest-cov  
**Code Quality**: flake8, black, isort, pylint  
**Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx  
**Task Queue**: Celery with Redis  
**Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow

### Performance Requirements (RNF-01)

All API endpoints MUST:
- Respond in < 2 seconds average (measured at 95th percentile)
- Handle 1000 concurrent requests without degradation
- Use database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Implement caching for read-heavy operations
- Use async tasks for long-running operations (Celery)

### Accessibility Requirements (RNF-06)

Frontend interfaces MUST:
- Comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Support keyboard navigation
- Include ARIA labels for screen readers
- Maintain color contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1
- Provide text alternatives for visual content

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Specification** (using `/speckit.plan`):
   - Create feature spec in `.specify/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`
   - Define user stories with priorities (P1, P2, P3)
   - Link to requirements (RF-XX, RNF-XX)
   - Identify affected user roles

2. **Planning** (using `/speckit.plan`):
   - Document technical approach in `plan.md`
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Validate against constitution principles
   - Create data models and API contracts

3. **Task Breakdown** (using `/speckit.tasks`):
   - Generate tasks organized by user story
   - Enable independent implementation and testing
   - Mark parallel execution opportunities [P]
   - Define MVP (P1 user story only)

4. **Implementation**:
   - Create feature branch: `###-feature-name`
   - Implement user stories in priority order
   - Write tests BEFORE implementation
   - Include traceability comments in code
   - Update API documentation

5. **Review & Integration**:
   - Code review MUST verify constitution compliance
   - All tests MUST pass with ≥80% coverage
   - API documentation MUST be updated
   - Merge to `develop` after approval
   - Deploy to staging for validation

6. **User Validation**:
   - Demonstrate to stakeholders
   - Collect feedback per Design Thinking Evaluate phase
   - Iterate if needed before production release
