**Date:** October 17, 2025

---

## Overview

This document outlines how Design Thinking methodology was applied throughout the SmartKitchen Connect project development, ensuring a human-centered approach to solving restaurant management challenges.

---

## Phase 1: Empathize

### Objective
Understand the needs, pain points, and motivations of all stakeholders in the restaurant ecosystem.

### Research Methods
- **User Interviews:** Conducted with restaurant owners, chefs, waitstaff, and customers
- **Observation:** Shadowing restaurant operations during peak hours
- **Surveys:** Digital questionnaires distributed to 50+ restaurants
- **Journey Mapping:** Documented customer and staff experiences

### Key Findings

#### 👥 Customer Pain Points
| Pain Point | Impact | Frequency |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Uncertainty about order status | High frustration | Very High |
| Long wait times without updates | Abandonment | High |
| Inability to modify orders | Poor experience | Medium |
| No dietary information | Safety concerns | Medium |

**Customer Quote:**
> "I never know if my food is being prepared or if the order was lost. The anxiety of waiting without information ruins the dining experience."

#### 👨‍🍳 Cook Pain Points
| Pain Point | Impact | Frequency |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Overwhelming paper tickets | Errors, stress | Very High |
| Unclear order priorities | Inefficiency | High |
| Missing ingredient information | Delays | High |
| Manual status updates | Time waste | Medium |

**Cook Quote:**
> "During dinner rush, I'm drowning in paper tickets. I can't tell what's urgent, and I waste time yelling updates to the waitstaff."

#### 📦 Inventory Manager Pain Points
| Pain Point | Impact | Frequency |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Surprise stock-outs | Service disruption | High |
| Manual inventory tracking | Errors | Very High |
| No demand forecasting | Over/under ordering | High |
| Delayed restocking alerts | Revenue loss | Medium |

**Manager Quote:**
> "We run out of key ingredients mid-service because I have no visibility into real-time usage. By the time I count inventory, it's too late."

#### 🍽️ Waiter Pain Points
| Pain Point | Impact | Frequency |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Communication gaps with kitchen | Customer complaints | Very High |
| No visibility into order status | Repeated inquiries | High |
| Manual order entry errors | Wrong orders | Medium |
| Difficulty handling special requests | Poor service | Medium |

### Empathy Maps

#### Customer Empathy Map
- **Thinks:** "How long will this take? Is my order correct?"
- **Feels:** Anxious, hungry, impatient
- **Says:** "Can you check on my order?"
- **Does:** Repeatedly asks waitstaff for updates

#### Cook Empathy Map
- **Thinks:** "Which order should I prioritize? Do I have enough ingredients?"
- **Feels:** Stressed, overwhelmed, rushed
- **Says:** "I need more prep time! Where's the waiter?"
- **Does:** Juggles multiple tasks, frequent context switching

---

## Phase 2: Define

### Problem Statements

#### Problem Statement 1: Information Asymmetry
**User:** Customer  
**Need:** Real-time visibility into order status  
**Insight:** Customers feel anxious without updates, leading to poor dining experience

**How Might We (HMW):**
> How might we provide customers with transparent, real-time order tracking that reduces anxiety and enhances their dining experience?

**Solution:** RF-04 (Order tracking with notifications)

---

#### Problem Statement 2: Kitchen Inefficiency
**User:** Cook  
**Need:** Clear order prioritization and streamlined workflow  
**Insight:** Cooks struggle to prioritize orders during peak times, causing delays

**HMW:**
> How might we help kitchen staff quickly identify and prioritize urgent orders while minimizing errors?

**Solution:** RF-01 (Digital order panel with visual priority)

---

#### Problem Statement 3: Inventory Blindness
**User:** Inventory Manager  
**Need:** Proactive inventory management with demand forecasting  
**Insight:** Reactive inventory management leads to stock-outs and waste

**HMW:**
> How might we enable inventory managers to anticipate demand and prevent stock-outs before they occur?

**Solution:** RF-03 (AI-powered demand prediction)

---

#### Problem Statement 4: Role Confusion
**User:** All Users  
**Need:** Clear separation of responsibilities and permissions  
**Insight:** Unclear roles lead to workflow bottlenecks and security risks

**HMW:**
> How might we design a system where each user has precisely the access and tools they need, no more, no less?

**Solution:** RF-05 (Role-based access control)
